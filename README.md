# task-tracker

Vue.js frontend for task-tracker app following Traversy Media's [Vue JS Crash Course 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=5698s). Rather than using json for the backend as the video suggests, I created a REST API using Express.js [find here](https://github.com/pearlhamilton/task-tracker-api).

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

- how to set up a Vue.js project
- Props 
- OnClick 
- created() method
- fetching data from API with vue.js
- Emitting events
- Data binding
